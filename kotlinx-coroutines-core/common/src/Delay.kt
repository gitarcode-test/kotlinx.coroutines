 * Suspends until cancellation, in which case it will throw a [CancellationException].

 * Usage example in callback adapting code:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * fun currentTemperature(): Flow<Temperature> = callbackFlow {
 *     val callback = SensorCallback { degreesCelsius: Double ->
 *         trySend(Temperature.celsius(degreesCelsius))

 *     } finally {
 *         unregisterSensorCallback(callback)
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Usage example in (non declarative) UI code:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * suspend fun showStuffUntilCancelled(content: Stuff): Nothing {
 *     someSubView.text = content.title
 *     anotherSubView.text = content.description
